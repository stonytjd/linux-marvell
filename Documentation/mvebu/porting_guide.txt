Introduction
============

	This section provides general and Marvell specific information about
	the Linux device-tree.

	The device-tree includes the runtime configuration of Linux Kernel.
	In addition, the device-tree enables passing configuration parameters
	for each of the drivers.

	For general information about the device-tree please refer to:
	http://elinux.org/Device_Tree

	Marvell's device-tree are located in the following locations:
	- arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell for 64bit devices (A37x0, A80x0 and A70x0)
	- arch/arm/boot/dts for 32bit devices (A38x and A39x).

	Marvell specific device-tree information (binding documents) will be
	provided later in this document.

==================================
Customer board device-tree porting
==================================

device-tree files:
-----------------
	Marvell device-trees consists of 2 types of file:
	- *.dtsi - Those files represents the SoC. Each available interface
			   has a node which holds the SoC information.
	- *.dts  - Those files holds the configuration of the board itself,
			   enabling/disabling nodes from SoCs, adding board information
			   to each node (if required).

porting procedure:
-----------------
	1. Choose one of the following example device-trees (for the SoC in use):
			arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-80x0-customer.dts
			arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-70x0-customer.dts
			arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-37x0-customer.dts
			arch/arm/boot/dts/marvell/armada-38x-customer.dts	/* TODO - generate */
			arch/arm/boot/dts/marvell/armada-39x-customer.dts	/* TODO - generate */
	   Copy the selected file, change the name and place the file
			in the correct folder, for example:
				./arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-8040-<new_name>.dts
				./arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-38x-<new_name>.dts

	2. Add the new device-tree file to the corrisponding Makefile:
			./arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/Makefile	(A80x0, A70x0, A37x0)
			./arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile		(A38x, A39x)
			For example:
			dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU) += armada-8040-<new_name>.dtb

	3. Look for "UPDATE" comments in the device tree and update board
	   specific information:
		- model: "Costumer board model"
		- compatible: "costumer-board-compatible"
		- Memory size: Update "memory" node properties
		- MPPs: pinctrl-0 = <handle>
		- PHY addresses for network nodes
		- COMPHY handles for network nodes
		- SPI flash (if needed)
		- I2c devices (if needed)

	Driver specific information can be found in the device-tree binding,
	refer to the next section on this document ("Device-tree bindings").

====================
Device-tree bindings
====================

	In order to make the porting of the drivers easier, each Linux driver
	has a device tree binding document which explains the usage of the driver.
	All binding documents are located in: Documentation/devicetree/bindings.
