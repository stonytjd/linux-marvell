Marvell's Xenon SDHCI Controller device tree bindings
This file documents differences between the core mmc properties
described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the Xenon implementation.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,xenon-sdhci"

- Input Clock Name
  Some SOCs require additional clock for AXI bus.
  The input clock for Xenon IP core should be named as "core".
  The optional AXI clock should be named as "axi".
  - clocks = <&core_clk>, <&axi_clock>;
  - clock-names = "core", "axi";

- Register Set Size
  Different Xenon SDHC release has different register set size.
  The specific size should refer to the SOC implementation.

Optional Properties:
- Slot Index
  Xenon can supports multiple slots in a single IP.
  Each SDHC slot has its own setting bit.
  The specific slot index in Xenon IP should be provided.
  - xenon,slotno = <slot_index>;
  If this property is not provided, slot index will be set as 0 by defalut.

- PHY Type
  Xenon support mutilple types of PHYs.
  To select eMMC 5.1 PHY, set:
  - xenon,phy-type = "emmc 5.1 phy"
  eMMC 5.1 PHY is the default choice if this property is not provided.
  To select eMMC 5.0 PHY, set:
  - xenon,phy-type = "emmc 5.0 phy"
  To select SDH PHY, set:
  - xenon,phy-type = "sdh phy"

- Customized PHY Parameters
  Some boards require different values of some specific PHY parameters.
  These properties enable diverse boards to customize the PHY parameters.
  The supported eMMC PHY parameters are listed in below:
  - ZNR
  xenon,phy-znr = <value>;
  - ZPR
  xenon,phy-zpr = <value>;
  - Disable Hardware DLL tuning
  xenon,phy-no-dll-tuning;

- Re-tuning Counter
  Xenon SDHC SOC usually doesn't provide re-tuning counter in
  Capabilities Register 3 Bit[11:8].
  This property provides the re-tuning counter.
  xenon,tuning-count = <count>;
  If this property is not set, default re-tuning counter will
  be set as 0x9 in driver.

Example:
- For eMMC slot:

	sdhci@aa0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,xenon-sdhci";
		reg = <0xaa0000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>
		clocks = <&emmcclk>;
		xenon,slotno = <0>;
		xenon,phy-type = "emmc 5.1 phy";
		bus-width = <8>;
		tuning-count = <11>;
	};

- For SD/SDIO slot:

	sdhci@ab0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,xenon-sdhci";
		reg = <0xaa0000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>
		clocks = <&sdclk>;
		bus-width = <4>;
	}
